The Border Gateway Protocol handles interdomain routing, where the domains are called [[Autonomous Systems (AS)]].
# Route Announcements
Route announcements contain the network prefix, a path vector, and the next hop
# Policy Implementation
Border routers only send route announcements to [[Autonomous Systems (AS)]] that are allowed to use the network. Border routers cheese the best path among the ones it gets.

A bridge also called a layer 2 (L2) switch is a way to extend a [[Local Area Network|LAN]] at the [[Data Link Layer]]. It is possible to use different standards, but this requires the same address structure, for example [[IEEE 802.3|Ethernet]] and [[IEEE 802.11|Wireless LAN]]. The bridge buffers frames and in so doing stops collisions between segments.

# Traffic Filtering
The [[Bridge]] filters traffic based on which [[Port]] it should go to. This is done by having a table matching [[MAC address]] to [[Port]] numbers. The learning of which port an address is on is done through a learnig bridge.
## Learning Bridge
When the bridge recieves a frame, it looks at the source address, if it is new it adds the address to the forwarding table, else it just forwards it to the correct port. Then it looks at the destination address, if the address is in the forwarding table, it forwards it to that port. Otherwise, the bridge [[Broadcast]] it and use the [[Acknowledgement|ACK]] to learn where that station belongs.

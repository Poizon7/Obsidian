[[Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)]] but add sensing while sending. If detecting a collision, back off and wait a random time before sensing the [[Transmission medium]] again. At repeated collisions, double the wait time. This is not suitable for [[Radio wave]] signals due to the high [[Attenuation]]. It also dose not work with hidden terminals. This does not reduce the risk of collisions but reduces the time cost.

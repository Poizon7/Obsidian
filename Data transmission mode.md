# Parallel
Parallel transmission has high capacity due to sending all data [todo] at the same time. But it also has a high cost due to needing to have several cables.
# Serial
Serial transmission is sending each bit of data seperatly. This requires the sender and reciver to agree on which bit (most or least significant) that is sent first. It also creates a syncronization issue. This can be solved by a external clock (GPS), a seperate wire, or the [[Line coding]]

# Parallel
Parallel transmission has high capacity due to sending all data #todo at the same time. But it also has a high-cost due to needing to have several cables.
# Serial
Serial transmission is sending each bit of data separately. This requires the sender and receiver to agree on which bit (most or least significant) that is sent first. It also creates a synchronization issue. This can be solved by an external clock (GPS), a separate wire, or the [[Line coding]]

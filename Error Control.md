# Forward error correction
Using an [[Error correction code]] to correct errors, replaces [[Cyclic redundancy check (CRC)]] but increases the amount of redundancy bits.
# Re-transmission
Using an [[Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ)]] to resend lost or corrupted frames.
# Hybrid
Using a combination, fixing small errors with correction but re-transmitting more corrupted frames.

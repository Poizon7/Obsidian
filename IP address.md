IP addresses are the addresses used in the [[Internet Protocol]]. They contain a network ID and a host ID.
# Separation
Originally the separation between the network ID and the host ID was done by the most significant bits. 
## Classes
### Class A
Class A was indicated by the first bit being 0. Indicating that the rest of the first byte was the network ID.
### Class B
Class B was indicated by the first two bits being 10. Indication that the rest of the first byte and the second was to be treated as the network ID.
### Class C
Class C addresses began with 110, and used the 3 first bytes.
### Class D
Class D was indicated by 1110, and was used for [[Multicast]] addresses.
### Class E
Class E was indicated by 1111, and was set aside for future use.

Modulation is how to distingish bits in a [[band pass channel]]
It can be done using [[amplitude]], [[frequency]], and/or [[phase]]
Each bit has a constant time

# Examples
- [[Amplitude Shift Keying|ASK]]
- [[Frequency Shift Keying|FSK]]
- [[Phase Shift Keying|PSK]]
- [[Qadrature Amplitude Modulation|QAM]]

Modulation is how to distingish bits in a [[band pass channel]]
It can be done using [[amplitude]], [[frequency]], and/or [[phase]]
Each bit has a constant time

# Examples
- [[Amplitude shift keying (ASK)]]
- [[Frequency shift keying (FSK)]]
- [[Phase shift keying (PSK)]]
- [[Qadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)]]

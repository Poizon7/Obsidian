$$T^{F}_{tr} = \frac{500}{1000} = 500ms$$
$$T^{A}_{tr} = \frac{8 \cdot 8}{1000} = 64ms$$
$$T_{pr} = \frac{500,000}{2 \cdot 10^{8}} = 2.5ms$$
$$U = \frac{T^{F}_{tr} + T^{A}_{tr}}{T^{F}_{tr} + T^{A}_{tr} + 2 \cdot T_{pr}} = 99 \%$$
Incorrect!!!

# C2
$$T_{tr} = \frac{1000 \cdot 8}{1 \cdot 10^{6}} = 0.008s$$
$$T_{pr} = 1.25s$$$$U = \frac{N \cdot T_{tr}}{T_{tr} + 2T_{pr}} = \frac{N}{1 + 2a} \geq 1$$
$$N = 1 + 2a = 1 + 2 \cdot \frac{T_{pr}}{T_{tr}} = 1 + 2 \cdot \frac{1.25}{0.008} = 1 + 156.26 \approx 157$$

# H1
In parity control you add one additional bit at the end of the data. Depending on if you use even or odd parity (that the numbers of ones should be even or odd), you add a 1 or a 0 to maintain that parity. 

The advantage is that it is simple to calculate and only requires on extra redundancy bit. On the other hand its ability to detect errors is very low.

In CRC you take your message, add a number of 0s equal to 1 less than the generator number and then binary divide it with that generator number (which has been agreed upon beforehand). The rest of that division is then used to replace the 0s placed at the end of the message previously.

CRC has significantly better error detection capability than Parity control, but requires more redundancy bits.

$$T_{tr} = \frac{10000}{1 \cdot 10^{6}} = 10ms$$
$$T_{pr} = \frac{75 \cdot 10^{6}}{3 \cdot 10^{8}} = 250ms$$
$$a = \frac{T_{pr}}{T_{tr}} = 25$$
## a
$$U = \frac{1}{1 + 2a} = \frac{1}{1 + 2 \cdot 25} \approx 2 \%$$

## b
$$U = \frac{N}{1 + 2a} = \frac{7}{1 + 50} \approx 14 \%$$

## c
$$U = \frac{N}{1 + 2a} = \frac{127}{1 + 50} \approx 250 \%$$

# H4
$$T_{pr} = 20ms$$
$$T_{tr} = \frac{x}{4000}$$
$$a = \frac{T_{pr}}{T_{tr}} = \frac{20}{\frac{x}{4000}} = \frac{80000}{x}$$ Incorrect!!!!
$$U = \frac{1}{1 + 2a} = 0.5$$
$$1 = 0.5 + 100a = 0.5 + \frac{8000000}{x}$$
$$0.5x = 8 \cdot 10^{6}$$
$$x = 1,6 \cdot 10^{7}$$

Add one extra [[Bit]] to match the parity (even/odd)
Receiver checks the number of 1s
# Even Parity
The total number of 1s should be even
# Odd Parity
The total number of 1s should be odd

# Advantages
Simple to calculate only XOR with all the bits
Only one extra bit per data unit
# Disadvantage
Can only detect odd amount of bit errors

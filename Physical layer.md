# Responsibility
## Transmitting a [[Bitstream]] over a [[Link]] connecting [[Node]]
## Converting between [[Digital Signal]] and [[Analogue Signal]]
### Encoding
Encoding is done through [[Line coding]], [[Block coding]] and [[Modulation]].
### Decoding
Decoding is done through [[Pulse Code Modulation]] and reversal of the encoding.
## [[Synchronisation]]
The transfer of signals requires the [[Synchronisation]] of the clocks.
# Other
## [[Transmission capacity]]
## [[Multiplexing]]

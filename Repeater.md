A repeater is a way to extend the signal on the [[Physical layer]]. This is done through [[Regeneration]] and [[Amplification]]. Using a [[Repeater]] requires that the same [[Medium Access Control]] protocol is used on both segments. For example [[Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection]]. The [[Frame]] propagate to all segments.

The [[Selective repeat ARQ (SREJ)]] is an extension of [[Go-back-N ARQ]] but the receiver sends a negative acknowledgement for lost or dropped frames. This requires the receiver to sort frames that has come out of order. The usable window size is $2^{k-1}$ where k is the number of bits in the sequence number.

# Requirements
[[Switched Ethernet]] only applies to [[IEEE 802.3]]
# Structure
Stations connected to a [[Bridge]]/[[Switch]] with [[Full Duplex]] [[point-to-point link]]. 
# Error Detection
This ensures no collision, so no [[Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection|CSMA/CD]]. 
# Flow Control
The flow control can be either end to end or with the switch. Forwarding and learning is the same as a [[Bridge]].
